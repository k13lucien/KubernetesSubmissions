### Chapter 3

##
-[3.9 DBaaS vs DIY]
||DBaaS|DIY|
|----|----|---|
|Pros|Easy setup: Just a few clicks or a single command to create a database|Full control: Customize configuration, tuning, and security as needed|
||Automatic maintenance: Updates, patches, and security handled by the provider|Lower cost: Only pay for the compute and storage you use|
||Integrated backups: Built-in automatic snapshots and restore options|Local integration: Perfect for local clusters (like Minikube/K3d)|
||High availability: Multi-zone replication, failover, and monitoring out of the box|Offline operation: Can work without internet connectivity|
||Scalability: Vertical or horizontal scaling without manual configuration|  |
||||
|Cons|Cost: More expensive over time compared to self-hosted solutions|Manual setup: Requires knowledge to install, configure, and secure|
||Limited control: Restricted access to server configs, logs, and tuning|Maintenance overhead: You handle updates, scaling, and monitoring|
||Vendor lock-in: Migrating between providers can be complex|Backup complexity: You must script or automate your own backups|
|||Risk of downtime: No automatic failover or SLA unless you configure it|
|||Security management: Patching vulnerabilities is your responsibility|
